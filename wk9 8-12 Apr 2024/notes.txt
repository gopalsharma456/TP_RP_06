::::::FlexBOX:::::::

flexbox places content based on available space without manually defining width and position etc.

step 1: container creation (flex) & place elements in it to to apply flex property.


step 2: flex-direction((by default row ), column) ---> VERY IMPORTANT for step 3

main axis - flex direction(if row then row)

cross axis - !flex direction(opposite)


step 3: alignment(justify-content, align-items)

application of alignment on elements:

justify-content - applies on main axis
align-items - applies on cross axis
