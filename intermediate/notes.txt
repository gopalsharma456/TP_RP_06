const : 
    1. variables can not redeclare, reassigned and are block scope

----------------------------------------OOPS-----------------------------------------------------


oops is programming model that organizes designed around object and data rather than function and logic.

this approach is well suited for software that is large and complex and actively updated

4 pillars of oops:
    1. Encapsulation
    2. Inheritance
    3. Abstraction
    4. PolyMorphism 

Encapsulation: 
    . It is defined as the wrapping up of data under single unit.
    . In this the variables or data of class are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any other member function class in which they are declared.

Inheritance: 
    . The capability of a class do derive properties and characteristic from another class called Inheritance.
    . types of Inheritance:
        - single Inheritance : derived from single parent 
        - Multiple Inheritance : derived from multiple parent
        - Multilevel Inheritance : one derived from other and other derived from another
        - Hierarchical Inheritance : parent to multiple child

PolyMorphism:
    . It means many forms.
    . defined as the ability of displayed in more than one form.

Abstraction:
    . It refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world hiding the background details or implementation.
